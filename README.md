Maximizing-Payment-Funnel-Conversions


Executive Summary: 
This project analyzed a subscription payment funnel with high drop-off rates, resulting in lost revenue. I identified friction points and provided recommendations to improve payment completion.  
1)  Tracked key events in the payment process
2)  Identified user/vendor errors causing drop-offs
3)  Recommended process optimizations to boost conversions



Business Problem:  
The company was facing a large loss in revenue due to customers starting a subscription but not completing the payment process. Many customers were abandoning the payment flow after opting for paid plans, which led to a lower-than-desired conversion rate. This issue needed to be resolved to improve customer retention and revenue.



Methodology:
1) Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Cleaned payment logs, removed incomplete records and merged multiple data sources to track the entire payment process.
2) Analytical Techniques:
3) Used SQL for data analysis, focusing on identifying friction points in the payment funnel.
4) Applied window functions to track customers' progress through the payment process over time.
5) Analyzed user and vendor error data to uncover common issues causing drop-offs.
6) Tools Used: SQL, Snowflake Data Warehouse, and Data Visualization tools 


Skills: 
-  SQL (CTEs, CASE, subqueries, window functions)
-  Data visualization
-  Data wrangling
-  Data cleaning
-  Data science notebooks
-  Snowflake Data Warehouse



Results & Business Recommendations: 
1) Friction Points: Identified significant drop-offs at critical stages such as entering payment details and third-party processing.
2) Error Analysis: Detected both user errors (incomplete data entry) and vendor errors (payment failures).
3) Recommendations: Optimized payment forms, improved error messaging, and implemented additional tracking mechanisms to monitor customer behavior more effectively.
4) Business Impact: Implementing these recommendations could result in higher conversion rates and reduced revenue loss.



Next Steps:  
1) Further Data Collection: Collect more granular data on user interactions to improve tracking and error identification.
2) Testing: Test the recommended changes to the payment flow to validate their impact on conversion rates.
2) Limitations: Some limitations arose from the data availability, which restricted in-depth analysis on certain error types. Further tracking and more detailed event data could provide deeper insights.
