Maximizing-Payment-Funnel-Conversions


Executive Summary: 
This project analyzed a subscription payment funnel with high drop-off rates, resulting in lost revenue. I identified friction points and provided recommendations to improve payment completion.  
- Tracked key events in the payment process
- Identified user/vendor errors causing drop-offs
- Recommended process optimizations to boost conversions


Business Problem:  
The company was experiencing a low conversion rate in its subscription service, with many customers beginning the sign-up process but failing to complete the payment. This created a significant revenue gap, as customers were not successfully transitioning from sign-up to paid subscriptions. The finance team needed insights into why customers were dropping off at various stages of the payment process.


Methodology:
- Analyzed the payment funnel by examining user event data from the **payment_status_log**.  
- Focused on tracking and measuring key events such as entering the payment portal, submitting payment details, and processing by a third-party vendor.  
- Identified where customers were abandoning the process or encountering errors.  
- Used SQL to query and aggregate data to calculate conversion rates at each step and uncover friction points.


Skills: 
-SQL (CTEs, CASE, subqueries, window functions)
-Data visualization
-Data wrangling
-Data cleaning
-Data science notebooks
-Snowflake Data Warehouse


Results & Business Recommendations: 
- Identified key friction points, such as issues with entering payment information and errors with third-party payment processing.  
- Found that both user errors (e.g., incomplete information) and vendor errors (e.g., card processing failures) contributed to drop-offs.  
- Recommended improving the payment process by simplifying forms, enhancing error messages, and refining the error handling system.  
- Suggested adding additional tracking mechanisms for future optimization.


Next Steps:  
- Implement recommendations to simplify the payment process and address identified friction points.  
- Continuously monitor user events to assess the impact of changes on conversion rates.  
- Explore further optimizations based on new data and user feedback.
